# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
# Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Iâ€™ve been tasked with a larger project: analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review. In this project, I pick amazon_reviews_us_Video_Games and use PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. Next, I use PySpark, Pandas, or SQL to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in your dataset.

the vine reviews are 48 and non vine are 15663
### What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 star
the vine reviews are 51.1 and non vine are 38.7
# Summary
Based on the analysis, it shows a positive bias towards the vine program. The graph shows that 51.1 percent of vine reviwes are 5 star reviews and 38.7% are not vine reviews. Also, this can be because they are getting a free product and they are more than happy to write a good review. Also, we need to take in consideration how much time does a vine customer has to write a review in amazon? a amonth? what if the product failed after two? .However, we need to add more data (mean,median,mode). This can be helpful to see if the data is skewed left or right.
